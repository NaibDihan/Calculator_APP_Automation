# Calculator App Test Automation
## Overview
### The project includes a test method that takes a series of arithmetic operations as input and verifies that the calculator app produces the correct result. The goal is to ensure that the calculator handles various expressions accurately.

## Test Method
### The doSeries method is designed to accept a string representing a mathematical expression. It then passes this expression to the calculateSeries method, which performs the calculations and verifies the output.

## Example
### public void doSeries() {
     calculateSeries("100/10*5-10+60");
}
